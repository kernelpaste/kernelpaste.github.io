Minimalism is not merely an aesthetic. The beauty of a thoughtfully trimmed image derives from its creator’s awareness of what makes up the essence of what they’re trying to capture. It comes from the absence of superfluity, a complete comprehension of what matters. Consequently, you can’t just throw things away and expect to thrive. Discard with care, and acquire with it, as well.

The response to the overwhelming amount of content on social media is not to replace your smartphone with a dumb phone; it’s to put your phone out of sight and out of mind, if you’re not interested in using it; it’s to minimize the cognitive overhead of resisting temptation; it’s to nudge your habits towards voluntarily giving it up, over a period of time. This is, fittingly, the non-glamorous, unsexy technique that resists dissemination via the same social networks you’re attempting to elude. 

Think hard about purchases, big or small. It goes without saying, but buying does feel good. It signals wealth, status, liquidity, freedom, cultural sophistication, a certain elan whenever you acquire with reckless abandon. The only drawback is when you’ve got to move. At some point, when the party’s over, the superfluity in your life begins to charge interest. A television, premiere in its prime, is now an artifact only second or third in its class. Thinner bezels are being showcased at CES as we speak. It’s here that you realize you’ve been played by some revenue monkeys in an air conditioned boardroom somewhere in Tokyo, and that your desire was not for resolution or colours, but the ephemeral kind of status you get by owning the best television. It’s a cliché, but it happens. You’ll know when you have a legitimate need for a television, but it won’t happen often. There are better choices for entertainment almost everywhere online, to the extent that entertainment itself isn’t already dominant in your life. I can only think of the communal theatrical scenario as the only real justification for owning a large and respectable television; it simply isn’t polite to expect guests to watch something on your laptop screen. If you’re watching a film on your own, think about precisely how that laptop screen isn’t cutting it. Yes, the blacks could be deeper; there could be more pixels; the material of the casing looks shoddy. These are all the various forms that status-chasing takes. Except in the case of those infatuated with the cinematic art, colour quality and pixel density are nothing more than proxies for the wealth of the owner. They are only relevant, from my point of view, to the extent that they affect your ability to comprehend and become immersed in the art of whatever content you view. If you do not watch artful things, you have no need of a better screen. If your immersion is not impaired by the age of your electronics, you have no need of a better screen. 

Minimalism is not about discarding size wherever it appears. I have written, by this point, possibly more words than are necessary. I continue because none feels superfluous to me. Your own life should be the construction and acquisition of material goods that you expect to contribute something lasting and meaningful. Words are, however, cheap, compared to things. Use discretion, and think forever, if you must. At least you won’t end up buying anything.
